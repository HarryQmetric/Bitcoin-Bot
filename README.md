# Bitcoin Price Chat Bot Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HarryQmetric/Bitcoin-Bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HarryQmetric/Bitcoin-Bot)

Log Book Entry 1-
The 1st at Qmetric I was given some reseacrh to do based on what this whole projects funcitonality which is to create a bot.
From what I have read today I will be creating an echo bot which returns the current rate of conversion of Bitcoin into Pounds, Euros
and Dollars.

Log Book Entry 2-
During the 2nd at Qmetric I continued on with further research and begun to understand how the echo bot was going to work.
I'm going to be using Google Hangouts which provides a template of code which I will then edit to better suit the requirements. I have 
created the echo bot in the Google cloud funcitons editor. The return provides a user who queries the bitcoin conversion rate in pounds, dollars or euros with the current rate but the output the user recieves does not have much detail other than a number the program fetches. 

Log Book Entry 3-
During the 3rd at Qmetric I continued on with the Echo bot that displayes the current conversion rate of bitcoin to 
Pounds, Euro and Dollars. I improved the code by adding the currency symbols to the corresponding currency, but in order to do this
I had to further understanding of Javascript and use my knowledge I already have from Python to help me understand 
and complete that task. 

Log Book Entry 4-
In the 4th at Qmetric I continued with the bitcoin bot and went a step further by adding a image of bitcoin next to the header. 
In addition, I learnt more about Json structure in terms of how data is and should be structured which helped me with understanding how to 
structure my own data I was dealing with. Also I have started on adding a link in the subtitle which will take a user to the coindesk 
page which I have not completed yet.

Log Book Entry 5-
During the 5th day at Qmetric I continued on with the Bitcoin Bot, rather than adding the link to the text so that users can click on it,
I created a format which had the Bitcoin query, then underneath the response, then underneath that is a button with the bitcoin logo which 
takes a user to the coindesk website. In order to complete that task I had to understand more about arrays and objects in JSON format.

Log Book Entry 6-
During the 6th day at Qmetric, I moved on from creating the Bitcoin Bot and developing it to testing it and what the process is of how 
totest your code using ava. Once ava is set up I will then begin research on how to use a platform called Travis. In addition to that I 
also set up a GitHub account in order to keep track of all my changes to the code. Also now that I've begun testing and using 
github, I have chanegd the editor to visual studio as the Google Cloud Functions editor does not provide the tools to be able to test the code 
myself.

Log Book Entry 7-
During the 7th day at Qmetric, I continued on with getting Ava installed and the begining of testing my code. I have looked at
tutorials on how to use ava, in particular the different commands ava uses. I also researched how to write tests in JavaScript.

Log Book Entry 8-
During the 8th day at Qmetric, I carried on with testing and wrote my first test for one of my funcitons called createMessage. The test
ensures that when the user gets the return value, it also comes with a header. One of the developers at Qmetric and I decided it
was best to begin with testing the function that was easiest to test so that I understood how to write tests correctly. 

Log Book Entry 9-
Today at Qmetric I continued on with writing tests. I finished writing tests for the first function and nearly finished testing
the second function. I have become more confident in writing tests in java script and I understand more about how testing works by 
not only testing if the code works as it should, but also fails when expected to and I'm understand more about why testing is a really 
important role in the programming life cycle as I conduct more tests on my code.

Log Book Entry 10-
During the 10th day at Qmetric I completed tests for the second function and I have moved on to testing the final funciton. This funciton
is slighlty harder as it involves a promise so I will have to learn about using async, await in my testing. In addtion to that I have
creates a Travis.yml file in Github in order to get Travis to work. Travis is also a testing platform and I use it so that it double 
checks all my tests.

Log Book Entry 11-
During the 11th day at Qmetric I completed all testing. I now have an understand of different testing types and how to write tests in 
Javascript. Towards the end of the session I started to look at Sinnon and nock. 

Log Book Entry 12-
Today at Qmetric a developer and I went over some questions I had in order to further my understanding of the programming cycle and to 
understand more about testing as throughout this whole project, testing has been the harder task to understand and implement. 

Log Book Entry 13-
During the 13th at Qmetric I begun learning about Sinon and nock. I was mainly focusing my attention on nock and implementing it into
my testing. Nock allows you to set up a fake network call in order to make tests more reliable by allowing you to control a network call
and creating it in such a way that proves it will work in the future for the real thing.  

Log Book Entry 14-
During the last day at Qmetric, we reviwed the entire project to ensure I did not miss out anything and I put together this README file
containing all the log book entries
